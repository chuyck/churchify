OCaml-based Lambda Calculus Abstractor.

#Project Conception:
Inspired by Alonzo Church's 1930lambda calculus, this project utilizes the functional programming language OCaml to translate OCaml code into lambda calculus function abstractions.

#Run:
dune exec ./src/main.exe

Running the above command in terminal will open a text interface wheere

#Future Plans:
->The end goal of this project is the successfully translate the entirely of the OCaml language to lambda calculus.
->An intermediate goal of this project is the transition from parsing string versions of OCaml to the OCaml AST. This would open a path to allow for file IO, rather than REPL-based IO. 
->A future vision of this project is an investigation into compiling lambda calculus into runnning code.
